## Getting started

If you haven't already, read and follow the [Setting Up Cloud9](#setting-up-cloud9) instructions below.

First thing, run the following command:
```
$ tutorial/setup me@example.com
```

Then right-click on `index.php` in the file tree and hit `Run`

At this point, you may open the working Drupal site by clicking `Preview` at the top, and click the "Pop Out into 
New Window" icon on the right of the address bar for the new browser tab that opens within the IDE.
